            <p>Hello! My name is Ivan Chulde, and I am from Ambato, Ecuador. I enjoy technology, and right now I am an electronics engineer. I also worked as a secondary teacher.
                I am married, and my wife's name is Cristina. Currently, I am serving at the church as the Bishop of the Pradera Ward, a role I have held for about a year.
                I would like to learn how to build my own website for my business. </p>
